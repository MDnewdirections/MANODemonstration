# MANODemonstration
This is a demonstration of Jupyter Notebooks and Python that I conducted at Maryland Association of Nonprofits Annual Conference in 2021. It is made up of a notebook file and several csv/excel files of leadeboards downloaded from Fangraphs. The notebook provides users with a very basic overview of how Jupyter Notebooks function, and how users can utilize Python and Jupyter to conduct easy data analysis on the fly.

In order to work with the .ipynb file you will need to download an IDE that is functional with notebook format. As recommended in my demonstration, Anaconda is a great place to start for new Python coders.
Once you've decided on an IDE, you can work your way through the notebook on your own and experiment with the data provided.

NOTE:
You'll need to copy and paste new filepaths into your notebook cells in order to read the files in pandas! :)
